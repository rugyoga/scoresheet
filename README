This is a Single Page Application written in Angular to implement
the SFPA Pool League scoresheet. It allows you to create two rosters
for the Home and Away team and allows you to keep the scores up-to-date.
It records wins and table runs.
It currently does not allow substitutions.
There is also no means to submit the result directly to the SPFA web-site.
